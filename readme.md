# VCS CLI

This is a basic command-line tool for version control, similar to Git. It helps you keep track of changes to your files. You can add files, commit changes, and see your commit history. You can also ignore files using a .vcsIgnore file.

## Features

- **Initialize Repository**: Create a new VCS repository.
- **Add Files**: Add files to the staging area so theyâ€™re ready to be committed.
- **Commit Changes**: Save the staged files with a message explaining the changes.
- **View History**: See a list of all commits.

## Installation

```
git clone <repository-url>
